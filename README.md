  - __(1) Hayes, R. L.; Armacost, K. A.; Vilseck, J. Z.; Brooks, C. L., III. Adaptive Landscape Flattening Accelerates Sampling of Alchemical Space in Multisite lambda Dynamics. *J Phys Chem B* 2017, 121 (15), 3626-3635. DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b09656.__
### Adaptive Landscape Flattening scripts for use with CHARMM/pyCHARMM Multi-site $\lambda$-dynamics.
### ALF was developed within the Brooks Research Group at the University of Michigan and is currently overseen by [Ryan Hayes at the University of California, Irvine](https://github.com/RyanLeeHayes).
### To download the ALF GitHub repository (housed on Ryan's site) execute the command: `git clone git@github.com:RyanLeeHayes/ALF.git`.
### ALF is an integral component of running MS $\lambda$ D in [CHARMM/pyCHARMM](https://charmm.chemistry.harvard.edu/main.php), software availble free of charge for academic and government laboratories.
### To install the repository clone it on your local computer and then:
